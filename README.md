# The Murder of Jones Gambit - High Concept
_There's something suspicious about the murder of Jones Gambit._

## Premise
You're a young detective investigating the murder of local celebrity Jones Gambit in Alley City. You wander through 3D and 2D levels, interacting with people and objects to find clues.

## Features
- Story-telling
- Interactive
- Mysterious and dark setting
- Clues that reveal the mystery of Jones Gambit's murder
- NPCs that appear to be hiding something


## Gameplay Outline
The gameplay largely relies on the story. As you explore Alley City, you will find out more about Jones Gambit from the people that live there. The people of Alley City know a lot about everyone there, but will they be willing to share information with you? They could lead you to clues, or refuse to talk to you at all. If the NPCs trust you, they will lead you to clues. Clues will be hidden in dangerous places, and you will have to avoid falls, make tricky jumps, and find and press buttons to find the clues.

## Technical

### Genres
- 2D Puzzle Platformer
- 3D Adventure Game

### Audience and Venue
Our audience will be players above the age of 10 that are interested in story-centered games. We are aiming for an ESRB rating of E10+. Our game will be available on PC, Mac, and Linux, as it is web-based.

## Tilt

### Player motivation
Players will be motivated to play through this game as they would want to figure out who Jones Gambit was and who his murderer was. The player will be attached to the NPCs as they will all have a backstory and/or information on the murder of Jones Gambit.

### Selling Points
Our game is unique because there aren't many detective/mystery games out there. Our game would also be unique as it switches from 2D to 3D levels. The switch between 3D and 2D will be simple to players as well as they would both use the same controls.

## Competition
