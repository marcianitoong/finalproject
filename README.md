## Gameplay Outline
The gameplay largely relies on the story. As you explore Alley City, you will find out more about Jones Gambit from the people that live there. The people of Alley City know a lot about everyone, but will they be willing to share information with you? They could lead you to clues, or refuse to talk to you at all. If the NPCs trust you, they will help you find the clues. Clues will be hidden in dangerous places, and you will have to avoid falls, make tricky jumps, and find and press buttons to get one step closer of discovering the murderer.

### Audience and Venue

### Player motivation
Players will be motivated to play through this game as they would want to investigate the horrifying murder of Jones Gambit. The player will be attached to the NPCs as they will have a backstory and/or information on what really happened on the night Jones Gambit was murdered.

### Selling Points
Our game is unique because there aren't many detective/mystery games out there. Our game would also be unique since it switches from 2D to 3D levels, which will be simple as it has the same controls.
